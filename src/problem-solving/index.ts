/**
 * 1. Understand the Problem
 * - Comment it out, break it down into an algorithm. Top-down, stepwise refinement
 * - Restate the problem in my own words
 * - Inputs that go into the problem?
 * - Outputs that come from the problem
 * - Can outputs come from inputs
 * - How should I label (what matters)
 * 
 * 2. Concrete examples
 * - User stories are concrete examples
 * - Unit tests are another example
 * - Start with simple examples. Given 2 + 3, should get output 5
 * - Okay, edge cases
 *    - empty inputs
 *    - invalid inputs
 * - visualize the output
 * - Progress with more complex examples
 * 
 * 3. Break it down
 * - Oh, only at this step do we break it down into a sequence of steps
 * - Topdown, stepwise refinement. Just comment out the steps to solve it
 * 
 * 4. Solve or simplify
 * - Solve it 
 * - Simplify if there's still edge cases
 * - Otherwise solve a simpler problem. Make progress on that
 * 
 * 5. Look back and refactor
