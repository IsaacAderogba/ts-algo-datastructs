/**
 * Bit of a step up from Linked Lists - different types of trees (trees, binary trees, binary search trees)
 * Tree: A data structure that consists of nodes in a parent/child relationship
 * Can't have siblings point to siblings, strictly parent pointing to child
 * Siblings are nodes with the same parent
 * Leaf is a node with no children
 * Edge is the connection between one node and another
 * 
 * Lists are linear, Trees are nonlinear (multiple ways to traverse a tree)
