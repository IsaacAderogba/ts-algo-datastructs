/**
 * Bit of a step up from Linked Lists - different types of trees (trees, binary trees, binary search trees)
 * Tree: A data structure that consists of nodes in a parent/child relationship
 * Can't have siblings point to siblings, strictly parent pointing to child
 * Siblings are nodes with the same parent
 * Leaf is a node with no children
 * Edge is the connection between one node and another
 * 
 * Lists are linear, Trees are nonlinear (multiple ways to traverse a tree)
 * 
 * Examples
 * - HTML DOM (dev tools and debugger)
 * - Network routing
 * - Abstract Syntax Tree (parsing and making sure it's valid syntax)
 * - Artificial Intelligence (Mini-Max decision tree for Tic Tac Toe game, look at all combinations)
 * - Folders in an operating system (Things with parent-child relationships are often trees)
 * - JSON
